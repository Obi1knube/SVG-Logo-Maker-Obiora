# 10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

## Your Task

Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes all of the tests. You’ll need to submit a link to the video **and** add it to the README of your project.

Refer to the [Video Submission Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide) on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.

> **Note**: There is no starter code for this assignment.
### User Story

```md
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated SVG given the following input entered by the user: `SVG` for the text, `white` for the text color, `circle` from the list of shapes, and `green` for the shape color. Note that this is just an image of the output SVG and not the SVG file itself:

## Additional Requirements

This Challenge combines many of the skills covered so far. In addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria, we’ve provided some guidelines to help you get started.

Because this Challenge requires a video submission, refer to the [Full-Stack Blog video submission guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide) for guidance on creating and sharing a video.

Your application should use [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like the following example:

```md
.  
├── examples/           // Example svg file(s) created with the app
├── lib/                // Folder for classes or functions
    ├── shapes.js       // Exports `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes
    ├── shapes.test.js  // Jest tests for shapes
    └── more...         // Additional files and tests
├── .gitignore          // Indicates which folders and files Git should ignore
├── index.js            // Runs the application using imports from lib/
├── package.json
└── README.md           // App description, link to video, setup and usage instructions           
```

> **Important**: Make sure that you remove `dist` from the `.gitignore` file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.
The application must include `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes, as well as tests for each of these classes using Jest. While not a requirement, it is recommended that you place any common functionality and properties shared by the `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes in a parent `Shape` class and use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes.

Each shape class should be tested for a `render()` method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.

The following example test should pass:

```js
const shape = new Triangle();
shape.setColor("blue");
expect(shape.render()).toEqual('<polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />');
```

You may need to add additional files in the `lib` folder for handling user input, writing to a file, etc. Writing tests for these additional files is **optional**.

## Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the application and passing tests.

* At least one sample SVG file generated using your application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project.

## algorithm
Import the necessary modules: fs for file system operations, inquirer for user input prompts, and any other modules you may need.



Create a function called generateLogo that will handle the logo generation process.



Inside the generateLogo function, use inquirer to prompt the user for the following information:



Text for the logo (up to three characters)

Text color (color keyword or hexadecimal number)

Shape (circle, triangle, or square)

Shape color (color keyword or hexadecimal number)



Based on the user's input, create an SVG string that represents the logo. You can use string interpolation or concatenation to build the SVG string, incorporating the user's choices for text, text color, shape, and shape color.



Save the SVG string to a file named logo.svg using the fs module.



Print the message "Generated logo.svg" to the command line.



Exit the application.



Create a main function called main that will be the entry point of the application.



Inside the main function, call the generateLogo function to start the logo generation process.



Add error handling to catch any errors that may occur during the process and display an appropriate error message.



Call the main function to start the application.



Test the application manually by running it and verifying that it prompts the user for input, generates the logo, saves it as an SVG file, and displays the appropriate messages.



Write unit tests using Jest to test the functionality of the application. Include test cases for each step of the process, including user input, SVG generation, file saving, and error handling.



Run the unit tests using Jest to ensure that all tests pass.



Create a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the application and shows the passing unit tests.



Upload the video to a video hosting platform and obtain the video link.



Update the README file of the project with the video link and any other relevant information.



Submit the project, including the code, README file, and video link, for review.




Note: Make sure to install the necessary dependencies (inquirer, fs, jest, etc.) and set up the project structure as described in the additional requirements.
